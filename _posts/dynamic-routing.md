# Spotting AI Hallucinations: Student's Guide to Differentiate between Fact and Fiction in AI outputs

Artificial Intelligence is transforming how teachers prepare lessons, design assignments, and research new curricula. With great power comes great responsibility, however, and among the most significant issues that teachers must be aware of is the phenomenon of AI hallucinations. These occur when a language model such as ChatGPT produces text that appears authentic but is either factually incorrect or completely fabricated.

In this blog, we'll cover:

1. What are AI hallucinations
2. Why language models produce them
3. How to identify hallucinated content
4. Methods and tools for authenticating AI-generated content
5. Classroom-ready examples and best practices

Whether you are utilizing ChatGPT to generate activity suggestions or looking up historical sources, this guide will prepare you to utilize AI in a reflective and critical way in your teaching.

## What are AI Hallucinations?

The word "hallucination" in the context of language models means text created by the AI that is factually incorrect or misleading despite being coherent and plausible. Put another way: ChatGPT is extremely well-trained in sentence completion. It guesses the next most probable word from patterns it has discovered in enormous datasets. Yet it doesn't know anything in the way that humans do. It doesn't rely on up-to-date facts or check for truth, it creates text that is statistically near human text or fluent human text.

❗ **Example:**

In June 2023, a New York attorney utilized ChatGPT to craft a motion which seemed to contain a high volume of phoney judicial opinions and legal citations. The attorney later stated that he had not expected ChatGPT to fabricate cases.

Here we see that the system has been hard wired to produce output to please the user without making a thorough search to confirm the accuracy of the results.

## Why do hallucinations happen?

Language models are not fact-checking software but probability engines. They are not tied to a live database or a factually correct repository of some sort. They are trained on an enormous body of language (books, websites, articles) and learn to predict human language patterns.

Reasons for hallucinations:

**Lack of grounding**: The LLMs are not tied to an outside fact-checking knowledge base unless specially paired with one (e.g., plugins or search-augmented models).

**Lack of Training Data**: The model has not had good examples for several of these tail queries, so the model "fills in the blanks" based on what sounds plausible.

**Overconfidence bias**: LLMs have the tendency to generate grammatically vetted but incorrect responses, which leads users to accept incorrect outputs.

**Prompts ambiguity Vague**: Open questions may cause the model to guess the intended meaning, and that can increase the potential for hallucination.

## Dangers of AI Confidence

Language models are not expressing epistemic certainty (knowledge based confidence), but are expressing statistical confidence that a sentence is right.

Let's assume a scenario where a student is asked a question for which they do not know the answer. Instead of replying "I don't know" the student attempts to create a possible-sounding response to give an impression of appearing to understand. This is similar to AI behaviour but devoid of conscience or intention.

**⚠️ Misconception:**

A huge misconception is that since it is AI generated, it has to be true.

But the reality is AI is capable of generating book titles, research papers, names and statistical data without warning which may not be accurate.

## Flowchart: Checking for AI Hallucinations

Below is a simple flowchart that will help a teacher to verify the authenticity of the AI generated material before proceeding to use it as a teaching material:

## Few Hallucinations Examples

Below are some examples of AI hallucinations that happened in the past:

* Microsoft Bing's chatbot proclaiming its love for New York tech columnist Kevin Roose.
* German journalist Martin Bernklau typed his name in AI tool, Copilot which gave a defamatory response that this person was a child molester who had admitted to his crime and was remorseful.
* Bogus Academic or Research Citations.

## How Teachers can handle AI Hallucinations

* Verify any claim that sounds too specific. If AI provides a fact, verify it using: Google Scholar or Goodreads or any websites have .gov or .edu in their URL.
* Ask AI to provide a link and then validate by visiting the link. There are chances of hallucinated citations.
* Leverage AI as an Idea Generation Tool such as asking for Project Ideas, essay templates, class activities.
* Avoid AI for creating important lesson plans, citing unchecked data, and grading complex responses.

## AI Hallucinations as Teaching Opportunities

As people are aware of AI hallucinations, it can be converted into a teaching instance. This can spark critical thinking ability.

Few ways to implement it as a teaching opportunity:

* Have students verify an AI generated response.
* Can be used as a "spot a mistake" exercise.
* Organize a classroom activity where students rectify the AI generated errors.

The above are a few ways AI hallucinations can be used as a positivity enforcement tool. It can upgrade digital literacy, improve research skills and make skepticism an important quality.

## Best Practices: Usage Policy in Classrooms

Few rules to be kept imperatively followed when incorporating AI in teaching toolkit:

* Mandatory Verification of AI generated content before use.
* Clearly labelling of AI generated content.
* Inform and discuss with students extensively about AI limitations.
* Use AI for inspiration and not authority.
* Avoid using AI for any assessments or fact recalling activities.

## Reducing Hallucinations with Structured Prompts

Structured prompts can significantly reduce hallucinations through several mechanisms:

```
- **Rules:
  - Only state facts you are certain about
  - Clearly indicate when you are speculating or uncertain
  - Do not invent specific details such as dates, statistics, or quotes
  - Cite sources whenever possible
  - Say "I don't have enough information" rather than guessin

- **Verification Process:
  - Present your initial response
  - Identify claims that require verification
  - Evaluate confidence in each claim 
  - Revise any low-confidence claim to be more cautious
```

## Conclusion

AI is an incredible technology that can save time, create new ideas, and support planning but responsibly. The key to using ChatGPT is to learn about hallucinations. As educators, you embody skepticism and responsible technology use. Using AI does not involve dispensing with skepticism, rather it is a matter of being even more cautious about employing the technology.

By showing students how to recognize and repair hallucinated content, you're not only preserving the integrity of your own teaching — you're preparing students for success in an AI tool-rich future.

Use AI to support your instruction but keep leverage your own rationale for decisions based on human judgement.
